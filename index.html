I love all the newest bikes they are coming up with. Every time they release a new model, it feels like Christmas morning!" </p> <p>

			<p> "I'm a long-time customer of Flash Motorcycles. I was so happy when they finally opened up a showroom here in my hometown.

			<p> I have been a customer of Flash Motorcycles for over 10 years now. They are the best at what they do and they have the best showroom in the world. I've been to other motorcycle shops but never found what I was looking for. Flash Motorcycles offers everything and anything you may need or want. I've ridden bikes all over the world, but my favorite is Flash! </p> <p> ~David Moore </p>
